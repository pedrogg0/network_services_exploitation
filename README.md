Before everything: make an nmap scan to find open and vulnerable ports.

## SMB

Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX. 

### Enum4linux

It is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares. Makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.

**SYNTAX** = "enum4linux [options] ip"

- -U             get userlist
- -M             get machine list
- -N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
- -S             get sharelist
- -P             get password policy information
- -G             get group and member list
**- -a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)**

### Exploiting SMB

#### Using SMBCLIENT

**SYNTAX:** smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]

Followed by: 

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port

 ## Telnet
 
 **SYNTAX:** "telnet [ip][port]"
 
 ###Enumerating telnet
 
 check:
 
 https://www.cvedetails.com/
 https://cve.mitre.org/
 
 for finding vulnerabilities.
 
 Also, we can find an obvious misconfiguration that let us exploit it.
 
 ### Connecting Telnet
 
 **SYNTAX:** "telnet [ip] [port]"
 
 In case we can`t see if we are executing what we type we can use **tcpdump**
 
 sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0 //tun0 = network interface in use
 
 We need to preface the commands in the telnet machine terminal with ".RUN"
 ex: .RUN ping -c 1 [attackingMachine.localhost] //we can use that command                      to see that we are correctly executing code]
