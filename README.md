My notes about network services exploitation

## SMB

SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX. 

### Enum4linux

It is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares. Makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.

**SYNTAX** = "enum4linux [options] ip"

- -U             get userlist
- -M             get machine list
- -N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
- -S             get sharelist
- -P             get password policy information
- -G             get group and member list
*- -a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)*
